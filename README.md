# intro_recommendersystem

Implement solution thought in class & Thompson sampling

#Our technique (Mai)

We arbitraly look up 1 day per medicine so we cover the 10 at least once. 
We sort and only retain for the next experiments those that produced a positive return, and so on.

Example of result:


#Thompson sampling: (LÃ©on)
Look up Beta-distribution and multi-armed bandit 
scipy.stats.beta
